// Problem statement
//
// Create a personâ€™s weekly pay stub based on hourly pay, hours, and mileage reimbursement.
// Determine their gross wage and net pay if they pay for health insurance and 17% in taxes (after health insurance).  
// Then it should add the mileage reimbursement to their wage at a rate of $.35 per mile. 
// Your program should accept the following information: 
// employee name (first and last as a single line), hours worked, hourly pay, 
// insurance cost, starting odometer reading, and ending odometer reading.
// It should output a pay stub 
// http://www.pay-stubs.com/sample-pay-stub/ Links to an external site. 
// with the employees name, hours, hourly pay, gross pay, net pay (after taxes and health insurance),
// reimbursement, and total pay (net pay and reimbursement).
