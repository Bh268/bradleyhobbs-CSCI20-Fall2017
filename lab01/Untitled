My name is Bradley Hobbs.
I am not majoring in anything, instead, I am taking college classes through concurrent enrollment.
I have aa slight background in Java, but haven't been studying it for awhile.
My goal is to further my knowledge in programming so that I can follow the career path of Software development.
